```

其中80，111，139，445，2049端口我们比较感兴趣，但是我先看smb服务，因为我怕他整幺蛾子

ps:它这个smb服务不知道是它靶机有幺蛾子还是我攻击机有幺蛾子，我用不了smbmap，而且我用smbclient访问目录有概率失败，如果你复现失败的话，多试几次

To put it simply: each of us owes a burden of loyalty to humanity itself, to the human project across time and space. This is not a minor matter, or some abstract issue for philosophers. It is a profound and significant part of every human life. It is a universal source of meaning and insight that can bind us together and set us on a path for a brighter future; and it is also a division, a line that must held against those who preach the gospel of self-annihilation. We ignore it at our peril.

This text was the source of considerable controversy in a debate between Byron (7) and Hermanubis (452).

What I propose, then, is that we are not born as entirely free agents, responsible only for ourselves. The very core of what we are, our sentience, separates us from and elevates us above the animal kingdom. As I have argued, this is not a matter of arrogance, but of responsibility.

To put it simply: each of us owes a burden of loyalty to humanity itself, to the human project across time and space. This is not a minor matter, or some abstract issue for philosophers. It is a profound and significant part of every human life. It is a universal source of meaning and insight that can bind us together and set us on a path for a brighter future; and it is also a division, a line that must held against those who preach the gospel of self-annihilation. We ignore it at our peril.

斯特拉顿的《论宇宙》中的这段片段似乎对祖先和创始人都具有重大意义。

阿米塔斯：但是，这告诉我们有关宇宙本质的什么，也就是我们正在讨论的？
斯特拉顿：这是我们必须回答的下一个问题。我们从自我开始，因为自我决定了我们作为个体的存在；但是，如果没有周围的事物，自我就无法存在。公民生活在城市中；城市生活在宇宙中。所以现在我们必须将我们发现的原理应用到更广阔的世界，并问：如果人就像一台机器，那么宇宙的本质是否也类似？如果是这样，从这个事实中可以得出什么结论？

# loyalty.txt翻译
这段文字在拜伦 (7) 和赫尔曼努比斯 (452) 的辩论中引起了相当大的争议。

因此，我认为，我们并非生来就是完全自由的个体，只对自己负责。我们存在的核心，我们的知觉，将我们与动物王国区分开来，并使我们高于动物王国。正如我所说，这不是傲慢的问题，而是责任的问题。

简而言之：我们每个人都对人类本身、对跨越时空的人类项目负有忠诚的义务。这不是一件小事，也不是哲学家的抽象问题。它是每个人生命中深刻而重要的一部分。它是意义和洞察力的普遍源泉，可以将我们团结在一起，为我们铺平通往更光明未来的道路；这也是一条分界线，一条必须与那些宣扬自我毁灭福音的人划清的界线。我们忽视它，后果自负。
